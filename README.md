# Algorithm Design and Analysis Course
#### 🏛️ Imparted in Universidad Rey Juan Carlos during 2023 for the Software Engeneering degree.

The scripts in this repository are divided into the codes reviewd in the lectures explainig the 
basic paterns of different kind of agorithms, and the codes writen to solve the different exercises
proposed during the course.

Here some examples of my favourite scripts:
* 🤔 [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis-Course/blob/master/Exercices/4.%20Backtracking/Casi-sudoku.py) - Using a backtracking algorithm.
* 🌲 [Minimal recovery tree costs calculator](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis-Course/blob/master/Exercices/2.%20Greedy%20algorithms/2.2.%20Graphs%20greedy%20algorithms/Attack-on-Titan.py) - Using Kruskal's algorithm.
* 🐄 [Count graphs conex components amount](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis-Course/blob/master/Exercices/1.%20Graphs%20covering%20algorithms/Hotia-pilotes.py) - Using a deep-first search.
